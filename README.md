# A Brief Introduction - Who Am I?
My name is Jordan Muller! I have a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science & a passion for helping people. I'm actively looking to connect with new people & organizations to see how I might be able to assist. Connect with me on LinkedIn if you'd like to add me to your network!

## Technical Skills
### Programming & Markup Languages:
My top languages are always changing as I continue to work on new projects, however, here is a rough estimate of the languages showcased publically here on GitHub:

While my current focus is on Web Development, I try to choose which language will be used for each project instead of always using what I'm comfortable with. Currently, I'm actively studying & specializing in:

### Libraries & Frameworks
Many Libaries and Frameworks can come into play with modern software development. While a lot of my library knowledge is based in Python, I'm currently learning about modern web frameworks such as React, Angular, Svelte, etc. When I'm feeling more comfortable with those frameworks I'll continue to add them here:

I've used many different Operating Systems & Distributions, however I am quite fond of Kubuntu because it includes KDE Plasma, I use Android on my personal phone, but I'm familiar with all common operating systems including Windows, macOS, and iPhone. I own devices that are able to run all of these systems:

## Thanks for Visiting!
Whew! That was a lot of badges! I didn't realize how many different technologies, frameworks, tools, and languages I was juggling until I went ahead and listed them here. I eventually want to find a better way of displaying all of this information, but for now this will do! While I'm currently familiar with many additional technologies, tools, and frameworks, I tried to only list the ones that I have logged many hours into using.

For example, I didn't list C++ as one of my languages because I'm not quite at the level of mastery I want to reach before displaying it as one of my skills.

I pride myself on being adaptible above all else, so if a specific tool or technology isn't listed here, don't assume I've never heard of it or used it, I might have knowledge and experience with them, but I only listed my best skills and tools here.

I would love to connect with anyone who's interested! Whether you're a Senior developer looking for a Junior, or a Junior looking for some advice, I'd love to connect and share ideas!
